        <h2>Hi, I'm Mo</h2>
        <p>This site is a little introduction about me.</p>
        <p>
          My name is Amogh Koratpallikar and I am currently a Senior enrolled in
          Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa. I am currently
          pursuing a BBA in Business Analytics and Information Systems. I have
          previous hands-on experience in data analysis and reporting,
          particularly in agricultural and financial sectors. I have worked two
          internships where I learned a broad range of skills including creating
          a PowerBI report for stakeholders, to assessing loan applications and
          analyzing financial statements to evaluate credit risk. I am always
          dedicated towards learning new things and exploring new opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been analyzing athletic statistics since I was young, and I
          used those numbers to make conclusions about them and compare it to
          other players for fantasy football. This created my interest of using
          data to determine results and make proper judgements.
